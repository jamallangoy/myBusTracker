# Real Time Bus Tracker 

# Description

This is a basic real-time tracker for a MIT campus bus.  Using mapbox, I've created a traditional map view and allow the user to update the location coordinates of the bus. Movement happens every 15 seconds.  Please pay attention to the map icon to see the difference in location after each interval.
