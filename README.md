# Real Time Bus Tracker 

# Version 1 - Week 9: Asynchronous Programming and Mapping (MIT XPro, June 2021)

# Description

This is a basic real-time tracker for a MIT campus bus.  Using mapbox, I've created a traditional map view and allow the user to update the location coordinates of the bus. Movement happens every 15 seconds.  Please pay attention to the map icon to see the difference in location after each interval.

# How to Run

1) Fork the "myBusTracker" repository
2) Clone onto your machine using Git
3) Drag and drop "realTimeBusTracker.html" into a new tab
4) Replace my API key for your own API key
5) Innovate it and teach us what you did and how you did it!!!

P.S. Please do not forget to register to MapBox in order to get an API key....
